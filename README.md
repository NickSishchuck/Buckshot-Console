### üé≤ Rules
At the start of each round, the shotgun is loaded with a random mix of blanks and real shots.
At least one blank and one real shot are guaranteed.
Players alternate turns, choosing to shoot themselves or their opponent.
Shooting yourself with a blank grants you another turn.
Shooting yourself with a real shot deducts 1 health and passes the turn.
Each player starts with 3 health points. The game ends when a player's health reaches 0.
